      <p>I’m a hardworking professional who is eager to earn a place as a developer with a local firm. After over a decade in construction, both as a leader and as an individual contributor, I’ve committed to overhauling my career. I quit my construction job in early 2019 and have since been committed to learning full stack web development through an intensive Trilogy program at Denver University. It’s been a joy to discover that the things that initially drew me into construction can also be found in development; where I used to get pleasure from a beautiful pipe layout, I now find it in pages of clean code. I am eager to prove myself and earn a seat at the table in my new profession. I will be the hardest working soul in the room when given my chance.</p>
